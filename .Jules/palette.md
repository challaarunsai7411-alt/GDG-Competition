## 2025-05-18 - Accessibility First
**Learning:** This codebase lacked basic accessibility features like "Skip to main content" and unique IDs, which are fundamental for keyboard and screen reader users.
**Action:** Always check for unique IDs and skip links in the observation phase.

## 2025-05-24 - Link Security and Accessibility
**Learning:** External links opening in new tabs were consistently missing `rel="noopener noreferrer"` and screen reader warnings. This seems to be a systematic oversight in the project.
**Action:** When working on any page with external links, automatically check for these attributes as a standard part of the "Visual Polish" phase.
